          <p>I made a website for Fietstrade where students could buy and sell bicycles. This was my first real rails app. The students running the site in the end had to focus more on their study, and there didn't seem to be enough interest generated in the site.</p>

          <p>After Dayleez and Fietstrade another entrepreneurial student contacted me to make his idea a reality. Studyrent offered a great selection of rooms for rent to a primarily international market of students. Studyrent is still active today (though no longer on my code base and design)</p>

          <p>The Erasmus Recruitment Days is an on campus recruitment event where 1000+ students come into contact with 100+ companies. Collecting assets like logos and event descriptions is part of managing this process. I created a rails application for the ERD to help them collect information from participating companies.</p>
